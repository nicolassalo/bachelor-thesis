# Bachelor Thesis

This is the repository for my bachelor thesis including programming code and written texts

## Current progress

Version 1 (01. April 2020):
* AI with API for detecting languages english, german and 4 others
* AI for sentiment analysis including
    * one API endpoint for evaluating the sentiment of a review
    * one API endpoint for adding reviews to the AI training data and
    * one API endpoint for removing accidentally added reviews from the AI training data
    * 200+ training reviews 


## How to use

The following section explains how to use the API for language detection and for sentiment analysis.
The API endpoints for adding and removing review training data is **password protected** and **not part of the service**.

#### Sentiment analysis API

* **URL**

  https://api.ishift.de/api/reviews

* **Method:**
  
  <_The request type_>

  `GET` | `POST` | `DELETE` | `PUT`
  
*  **URL Params**

   <_If URL params exist, specify them in accordance with name mentioned in URL section. Separate into optional and required. Document data constraints._> 

   **Required:**
 
   `id=[integer]`

   **Optional:**
 
   `photo_id=[alphanumeric]`

* **Data Params**

  <_If making a post request, what should the body payload look like? URL Params rules apply here too._>

* **Success Response:**
  
  <_What should the status code be on success and is there any returned data? This is useful when people need to to know what their callbacks should expect!_>

  * **Code:** 200 <br />
    **Content:** `{ id : 12 }`
 
* **Error Response:**

  <_Most endpoints will have many ways they can fail. From unauthorized access, to wrongful parameters etc. All of those should be liste d here. It might seem repetitive, but it helps prevent assumptions from being made where they should be._>

  * **Code:** 401 UNAUTHORIZED <br />
    **Content:** `{ error : "Log in" }`

  OR

  * **Code:** 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTRY <br />
    **Content:** `{ error : "Email Invalid" }`

* **Sample Call:**

  <_Just a sample call to your endpoint in a runnable format ($.ajax call or a curl request) - this makes life easier and more predictable._> 

* **Notes:**

  <_This is where all uncertainties, commentary, discussion etc. can go. I recommend timestamping and identifying oneself when leaving comments here._>
